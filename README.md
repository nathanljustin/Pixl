# Pixl

Pixl is an app idea in which users will get to find all the best hangout places based on the recommendations of their peers. Users can submit blog posts that have comments, ratings, photos, etc. of places, which appear on one stream that everyone in an organization can see and upvote or downvote. There is also a map feature that has pins in all the best places. The bigger the pin, the more popular.

The general concept is laid out in this repository for the purpose of presenting the basic concept, but functionality is not implemented.
